# About
Oddly Ever After is a 3D game I am currently developing using Unity. It is my final project for Game Development course at Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Sarajevo.

# 📖 Storyline
Oliver Odd got nervous about his wedding to his fiance, Daisy Dusk, so he decided to run off into the woods. He soon realized Daisy was the love of his life and rushed to return to her, but on his way back he got trapped in an ancient graveyard in the world of the dead and became a ghost. 

Oliver must find his way out before the sun rises, or he will never see Daisy again and will stay a ghost forever.

# 🎮 Game
The game has 3 levels and the goal in each level is to find the key to unlock gate. The player, in the role of Oliver's ghost, faces ghosts of the graveyard, as well as the master of the graveyard, Skullcrusher Sam, who try to stop him from escaping.
